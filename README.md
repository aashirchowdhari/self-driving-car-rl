# 🚗 Autonomous Car using DDQN

This project implements a **Deep Double Q-Network (DDQN)** agent for autonomous driving in a simulated environment.  
The goal is to train a self-driving car to navigate and avoid obstacles using **Reinforcement Learning** techniques.

## 📌 Features
- Implementation of **Deep Double Q-Learning (DDQN)**  
- Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy  
- Replay memory for experience replay  
- Target network for stable learning  
- Car simulation environment (custom or OpenAI Gym)  
- Training and evaluation scripts
